                                        Any disputes arising out of or related to these Terms or the Service shall be resolved through binding
                                        arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration
                                        shall be conducted in San Francisco, California.
                                    </p>

                                        You agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and
                                        not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court
                                        rather than in arbitration, you waive any right to a jury trial.
